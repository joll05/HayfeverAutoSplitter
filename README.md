# HayfeverAutoSplitter
An autosplitter for the game 'Hayfever', made with auto splitting language (asl) for livesplit.

## Usage
To use it, please download the 'HayfeverAutoSplitter.asl' file and add a 'Scriptable Auto Splitter' component to your layout (located under the 'Control' tab). Then, in the settings for the scriptable auto splitter component specify the path of the 'HayfeverAutoSplitter.asl' file. Please note that when you run other games the autosplitter will not do anything.

Note: it will only work on version 1.0.2 of the game (latest version as I am writing this). I will get it to work on other versions in the future.

## Features
+ Pauses timer during loading screens ('Game time' needs to be enabled for this to work)

### Future Additions
+ Automatic splitting
    + Decide if you want to split every day, week or month
+ Automatic starting
    + Will be able to start either on entering a savefile or on entering a level
